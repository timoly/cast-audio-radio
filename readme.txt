Cast Audio Radio

HLS radio stream support for Mopidy (https://www.mopidy.com).
This utility uses VLC for actual playback and stream http outputting.
It only provides support for starting and stopping VLC based on actual stream requests.
Similar functionality can be found in Livestreamer (http://docs.livestreamer.io/index.html)
but I had problems using it with some HLS streams with Mopidy and PulseAudio output.
